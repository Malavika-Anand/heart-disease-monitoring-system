# heart-disease-monitoring-system
This is a project done by using Django as a framework and Machine Learning techniques for the prediction of heart disease.

Heart disease is one of the most critical human diseases in the world and affects human life very badly. In heart disease, the heart is unable to push the required amount of blood to other parts of the body.

The symptoms of heart disease include shortness of breath, weakness of physical body, swollen feet, and fatigue with related signs, for example, elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral enema caused by functional cardiac or noncardiac abnormalities.

Accurate and on time diagnosis of heart disease is important for heart failure prevention and treatment.

The heart disease diagnosis and treatment are very complex, especially in the developing countries, due to the rare availability of diagnostic apparatus and shortage of physicians and others resources which affect proper prediction and treatment of heart patients therefore accurate and proper diagnosis of the heart disease risk in patients is necessary for reducing their associated risks of severe heart issues and improving security of heart

To classify healthy people and people with heart disease, non invasive-based methods such as machine learning are reliable and efficient. In the proposed study, we developed a machine-learning-based diagnosis system for heart disease prediction by using ECG Frequency Signals.
